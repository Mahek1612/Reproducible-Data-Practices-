## What is reproducibility? Why does it matter?

Reproducibility means different things depending on the context. For us, in the context of bioinformatics and computational oncology, reproducibility means to provide enough information (data, code, etc) to allow someone to replicate the exact analysis and arrive at the same results. 

> Reproducibility = Obtaining the same results when using the **same** code, data and *conditions of analysis.*






> Replicability = Obtaining similar results across studies using **different data**.
